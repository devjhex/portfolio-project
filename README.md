# Portfolio project built with HTML and CSS

## Overview
This project was meant to test my HTML and CSS skills to the fullest where I had to build a portfolio website for people or other users to find out what i have worked on for example projects, platforms and social media presence etcetera.

## Tech stack 
As mentioned the project was built with pure HTML and CSS (no frameworks used e.g tailwind or Bootstrap)
